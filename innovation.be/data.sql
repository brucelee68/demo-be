Reduce the workload of the technical leader
Improve Agile spirit and proactive at work', 'Most people think that ownership is to take care of all parts of the application. Then make a plan so that the team can take care of the project without customer involvement. That is a good improvement.
-> But for me, I think ownership comes from individual problem solving and self-research. Develop that ownership for each member then combine with teamwork skills so that a team can take ownership effectively.
So, how can we improve problem-solving and self-research skills?
Actively observe and learn from people who have more experience than you. For example, we receive a task/request from the clients, it can be hard for me but seems very simple for TuanNA58 as the technical leader. He can bring the solution immediately but he does not tell me directly, he draws many things around this task like if I want to do this, what I need to do first, second,… And I will do research by myself. After a couple of times, I can do it myself, I can draw my own directions to solve that problem and do my own research.
Whenever you find something useful for you and for work, make a note of it, save it for later use. It will help shorten your brainstorming time when solving a related problem.
Participate in workshops or courses on problem-solving skills.
Research and learn more about necessary tools, keywords, tech stacks for work to shorten the self-research time.
Besides, lets raise the spirit of team works to solve bigger problems. When the members have good problem-solving skills and combined with teamwork, the team will go up quickly and strongly.
When a team is strong, keep learning the good points of other teams, sharing with each other will help a project team always be ready to take ownership as teamwork.',

The widgets we are building based on the specific technologies at a time. They are required to upgrade to keep up-to-date the trend of technologies. The upgrade versions of widgets can be frequently. There could be hundreds of widgets further that are using across the system.
Yolo team has worked to upgrade all Osiris widgets using the latest ws-scripts so that the latest bug fixes and functionality are present for all widgets. We have plenty of widgets that need to be updated with the current version spanning from v12 to v15. The number of widgets that need updating is about 30+ widgets. Updating these widgets has to be done manually, and there is a difference in the process of updating to the latest version for each specific version. Although we have relied on the practical experience gained when updating the ws-scripts version to build a document about the update process, this still has a few problems to fix. There are some issues or difficulties as below:
Human mistake: each version has a lot of manual steps we have to follow to update the ws-scripts to the latest version. With each specific version, we also have a different process. So, if not carefully, we can have a mistake while updating.

Normally, smoke testing will be done manually by QA after deploying a new version. But COX does not recommend manual test because they concern about several issues may occur on production as below:
Trash data: Putting data into Prod has to be done with care and forethought. COX does not want to add anything to Prod that can detrimentally affect anything else. And, after the team has taken all precautions, any data added to Prod MUST be cleaned up (that must be stressed).
Run continuously: Whatever method is chosen; it should not be something that is run from the local machine if it can be helped. COX expects that we should strive for something that can be run by anyone at any time, without wondering if their local environment is set up correctly to run it. Moreover, they also want the test to run continuously and not just at deploy time.
Security: To perform the smoke test on prod, the team needs credentials provided by Cox. However, COX certainly would not provide any credentials to access prod because of security reasons. They expect that team should think about how to validate functionality in production without escalated permissions.
The team needs to propose a solution for smoke tests that meets all the above requirements before deploying the product.', 'Make sure smoke tests do not affect real data on Prod and all test data on Prod must be cleaned up.
The smoke test should be run continuously.
Do not run smoke tests on the local environment.
The team has to run smoke tests on production without escalated permissions.', 'Suggest New Relic Synthetics:
Actually, we can run smoke tests manually such as Postman tool, but we were thinking about a tool that is easier and more reliable to automate critical workflows. So, team suggested that using synthetic monitoring API tests to monitor Latte API endpoints to ensure they are functioning correctly. And finally, we got approval from COX.
New Relic Synthetics - overview:
The synthetic monitoring API tests are available on New Relic which is very commonly used by COX. The monitor can be configured to secure a credential.
New Relic Synthetics is a powerful tool in the observability toolbox, but it is easy to overlook when developers are focusing on application metrics, error rates, and logs. However, once you set up synthetic monitors, you can test on-demand and on a regular basis, which improves your confidence in your deployments to production and, ultimately, improves your CI/CD pipelines.
New Relic Synthetics - initialization and management:
Synthetic monitoring is easily managed and configured: Active/Inactive, Setup location, schedule execution time. It allows us to change the configuration at any time.

The script can be validated during the creation process, all secret keys are strictly confidential. COX commit to create secure credentials for the team to implemented New Relic Synthetics.

Tests can be created in advance and run at Stage to make sure it works well before moving to Prod. If script has any issues, it will be detected and corrected soon.
Synthetics script also provides assert functions that allow us to validate the response results after calling the API:
assert.equal(result.response.statusCode, 200, Create data SUCCESSFUL);
New Relic Synthetics - state tracking:
Once the Synthetics is created, it will run continuously as it was configured. And we can track sate of Production easily: success rate, maximum execution time, average execution time, failure/success rate, trigger smoke immediately by click run check button.

It also shows the executed test scenarios as well as logging. We ensure the smoke test was run as expected. It helps us to have an overview of the smoke test scenario and limit the errors that can occur due to carelessness.
', 'New Relic Synthetics automation testing can be used by most projects in C99, because not only it can test for API but it can also test for Web UI.
As long as the team has the product (API/Web) deployed on the dev/stage/prod environment and team has account to access to New Relic.
This also reduce effort and very useful for QA/Tester team', 'Reduce efforts for smoke testing/deployment time: for medium and large services those have from 5 to 10 APIs come up. Usually, it takes more than 15 minutes to do smoke tests manually after we deploy a new version. With automated testing by New Relic tool, it just takes less than 1 minute. For instant, max execution time of Latte is 3.88s (4 APIs).
Prevent human mistakes: all test cases are run automatically, minimize the risk of affecting real data.
Team can do smoke tests without escalated permissions: COX will provide a new set of credentials (Ex: Client ID, Secret Key…) to be used for New Relic Synthetics. So that team can use credentials without worrying about security issues.
Smoke tests are run continuously instead of one-time after deploying: ensure product quality during operation. If there is an issue, the team can get the alert message via mail, Slack channel, Pager Duty call etc.
Last but not least, Latte has tried the New Relic synthetic that was approved by Cox and deployed successfully; it is crucial evidence to present our ownership mindset and the spirit of continuous improvement.',
